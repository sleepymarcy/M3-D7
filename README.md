PAIR PROGRAMMING EXERCISE.
      1 DRIVER, 1 NAVIGATOR.
      1 Exercise each. Use GitHub to share the code.
      Less exercise, more complicated. 
      Ex1) Get and display, using async / await, the users from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
      Ex2) Create a dropdown (<select>) that allows the user to select between name, username and email. 
           Create then a filter. When the user types in something, you should filter the user based on the input and on the value of the select.
           Es.: select on NAME. Filter input = Glenna, only user id number 9 should remain
      Ex3) Create a function that, from the list of users, extracts only the names
      Ex4) Create a function that, from the list of users, creates an array of addresses as string and not as an object. Like:
              {
              "street": "Victor Plains",
              "suite": "Suite 879",
              "city": "Wisokyburgh",
              "zipcode": "90566-7771",
              "geo": {
                "lat": "-43.9509",
                "lng": "-34.4618"
              }
          Should become Victor Plains, Suite 879, Wisokyburgh (90566-7771)
      
      Ex5) Add a button that sorts the list by name ascending / descending (ONE button)
      Ex6) Add a link on each user, when clicked it must go to a detail page, where to user information are presented (from the API)
      EXTRA)
      Visualize on a Google Map plugin all the users (using lat & lng)
